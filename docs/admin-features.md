# Admin Features & Referral System

## Status: âœ… Complete

## Admin Authentication
- **Hard-coded admin login** for MVP phase
- No real authentication validation required for prototype
- Admin credentials should be stored as environment variables
- Simple login form that checks against hard-coded values

## Admin Panel Features

### Referral Link Generator
The core admin tool for creating custom signup experiences.

#### User Flow:
1. **Admin Access**: Admin logs in with hard-coded credentials
2. **Link Creation**: Admin clicks "Generate Referral Links" button
3. **Customization Prompt**: Modal/form appears with:
   - Text input for custom welcome message
   - Dropdown for background color selection (predefined colors)
   - Submit button to generate links
4. **Link Generation**: After submit, display two clearly separated links:
   - **Investor Link**: For investor signups with custom styling
   - **Founder Link**: For founder signups with custom styling
5. **Link Expiration**: Links expire after 24 hours

#### Technical Requirements:
- Generate unique link IDs/tokens for each referral campaign
- Store link data temporarily (24-hour TTL)
- Include custom message and background color in link parameters
- Clear visual separation between investor and founder links
- Copy-to-clipboard functionality for easy sharing

## Referral Landing Pages

### Custom Welcome Experience
When users click referral links, they should see:
- Custom welcome message from admin
- Custom background color
- Role-specific messaging (investor vs founder)
- Clear "Get Started" call-to-action

### Fake Signup Flow
For prototype phase:
- **Quick Signup Form**: Basic fields (name, email, etc.)
- **No Validation Required**: Allow empty or invalid data
- **Skip-Through Capability**: "Next" buttons to quickly advance
- **No Real Account Creation**: Just simulate the flow
- **Immediate Redirect**: Land on appropriate dashboard

## Dashboard Destinations

### Investor Dashboard (Sample)
After completing fake signup, investors see:
- Sample deal flow from MVP requirements
- Mock company cards with fake data
- Basic filtering interface
- Sample tracking functionality

### Founder Dashboard (Sample)
After completing fake signup, founders see:
- Sample profile completion interface
- Mock investor interest indicators
- Fake traction update forms
- Sample "knock" notifications

## Data Storage
- **Temporary Storage**: Use localStorage or simple in-memory storage
- **Link Metadata**: Store custom message, color, creation time, expiration
- **No Persistent Users**: Don't create real user accounts
- **Session Simulation**: Use temporary session tokens

## UI/UX Requirements

### Admin Interface
- Clean, simple admin panel design
- Prominent "Generate Referral Links" button
- Modal/popup for link customization
- Results page with copy-able links
- Basic navigation (logout, home)

### Referral Pages
- Mobile-responsive design
- Custom background colors applied via CSS
- Professional appearance despite being a prototype
- Clear role differentiation (investor vs founder branding)

### Color Options (Dropdown)
Predefined background color options:
- Blue (#3B82F6)
- Green (#10B981)
- Purple (#8B5CF6)
- Orange (#F59E0B)
- Red (#EF4444)
- Gray (#6B7280)

## MVP Phase Constraints
- **No Real Authentication**: Hard-coded admin access only
- **No Database Persistence**: Temporary storage only
- **No Email Integration**: Just link generation
- **No Analytics**: Basic prototype without tracking

2. Links properly redirect to branded signup pages
3. Signup flow is smooth and skippable
4. Users land on appropriate sample dashboards
