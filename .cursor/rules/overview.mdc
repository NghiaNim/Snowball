# Snowball Platform Overview

## Mission
Snowball is a two-sided platform that connects early-stage, high-potential startups with early-stage VC investors through curated deal flow and tribe-based networking.

## Core Concept
The platform leverages "tribes" - communities built around commonalities like accelerators, universities, companies, countries, or industries - to create high-quality, targeted connections between founders and investors.
