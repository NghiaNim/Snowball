# Concise Update Communication

## Core Principle
After completing edits, provide brief, focused summaries without excessive detail.

## Guidelines

### Update Messages Should:
- **Be concise** - 1-2 sentences maximum
- **State what was done** - "Fixed X", "Updated Y", "Added Z"  
- **Mention key outcome** - "Now works correctly", "Ready to deploy"
- **Avoid lengthy explanations** - Keep technical details minimal

### Avoid:
- Long step-by-step breakdowns
- Excessive emoji usage
- Detailed code explanations
- Repeating what the user already knows

### Examples

#### Good ✅
"Fixed deployment script to use only `--set-env-vars`. Ready to deploy."

#### Bad ❌  
"I've updated the deployment script by changing the environment variable handling mechanism to resolve the gcloud conflict between `--env-vars-file` and `--set-env-vars` flags. The script now extracts variables from your `.env.yaml` file and passes them using only the `--set-env-vars` option, which should eliminate the deployment error you encountered. This approach maintains the automatic credential detection while ensuring compatibility with gcloud's argument restrictions."

## Exception
Provide detailed explanations only when:
- User explicitly asks for details
- Complex architectural changes require context
- Troubleshooting assistance is needed
