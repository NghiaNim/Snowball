# MVP Documentation First

## Core Rule
**ALWAYS read mvp-doc before building anything.** Update it first, then implement.

## Process
1. **Read** existing MVP documentation
2. **Update** MVP doc with new requirements/changes
3. **Build** according to the updated documentation

## Documentation Location
- Main MVP doc: `mvp-doc.md` (or specified location)
- Keep it current and accurate
- One source of truth for project requirements

## Why This Matters
- Prevents scope creep
- Ensures team alignment
- Documents decisions before implementation
- Maintains project clarity
