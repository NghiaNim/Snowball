# Snowball Development Setup

## Project Overview
Snowball is a two-sided platform that connects early-stage startups with investors through tribe-based networking. This MVP includes the basic foundation with a landing page and authentication structure.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15 with App Router, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS v4
- **Backend**: Supabase (PostgreSQL, Auth, Storage, Realtime)
- **Development**: ESLint, Prettier, TypeScript strict mode
- **Deployment**: Vercel (frontend) + Supabase (backend)

## Getting Started

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Environment Setup
Copy the environment variables:
```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

Then edit `.env.local` with your actual values:
- **Supabase**: Create a project at https://supabase.com and get your URL and keys
- **Resend**: Get API key from https://resend.com (for email)
- **Stripe**: Get keys from https://stripe.com (for future payments)

### 3. Development Commands

```bash
# Start development server with Turbopack (default, faster)
npm run dev

# Start development server with Webpack (fallback if needed)
npm run dev:webpack

# Lint code
npm run lint

# Check linting without fixing
npm run lint:check

# Format code with Prettier
npm run format

# Check formatting
npm run format:check

# Type check
npm run type-check

# Build for production
npm run build

# Start production server
npm start
```

## Development Guidelines

### Code Style
- Use TypeScript with strict mode
- Follow Next.js App Router conventions
- Use Tailwind CSS utilities over custom CSS
- Implement proper error handling
- Use Zod for data validation (when needed)

### Component Organization
- Keep components small and focused

- Investor profiles (criteria, preferences)
- Company profiles (basic info, fundraising status)
- Tribes (communities/networks)
- Tribe memberships
- Tracking (investor interest in companies)
- Knocks (meeting requests)
- Traction updates
